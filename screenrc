# -------------- Debugging old version of GNU Screen + Emacs scrollback issues on ALCF Theta (2020-06-15) -------
# Version on ALCF Theta:
# Screen version 4.00.04devel (GNU) 8-Jun-12 --- must be a critical bugfix released much later than v4.0.0
# vs. on Princeton Traverse:
# Screen version 4.01.00devel (GNU) 2-May-06
# Assuming SemVer, this is a newer minor version, but much older release date, than the ALCF Theta system version
#
# My install_screen.sh script replaces the system GNU Screen version with:
# Screen version 4.08.00 (GNU) 05-Feb-20

# GNU Screen ChangeLog is incomplete; was not used between 1994 (~v3.5.1) and 2014 (v4.2.0)
# See http://git.savannah.gnu.org/cgit/screen.git/tree/src/ChangeLog?h=v.4.8.0
