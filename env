# For example, let /home/kfelker/bin come before PATH /usr/bin to shadow system binaries
# (.zshrc runs "source $ZSH/oh-my-zsh.sh" which prepends this to PATH for ALL interactive
#  shells, login or non-login)
#PATH=$HOME/bin:$PATH

# $HOME local Emacs, Git, tmux installation directories (and possibly GNU Screen, autoconf, Tree)
PATH=$HOME/myemacs/bin:$PATH
PATH=$HOME/mygit/bin:$PATH
PATH=$HOME/bin:$PATH
# PATH=$PATH:/bin # ???

# Local Python binaries, like flake8 needed for flycheck (pip install --user flake8)
PATH=$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH

export MANPATH=/home/felker/share/man/:$MANPATH
