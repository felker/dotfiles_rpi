# ~/.zprofile
# Similar to .zlogin, but sourced only for login shells BEFORE .zshrc
# (created for ksh fans, not intended to be used with .zlogin, although possible)

# Kyle: decision made to put environment variable changes via "source .env" in .zlogin
# for consistency. Nothing really should go in this file.
