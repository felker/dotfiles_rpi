# dotfiles_rpi
System configuration files for my Raspberry Pi devices, including:
- Raspberry Pi 3 Model B
- Raspberry Pi Zero W
- (eventually) Raspberry Pi 4 Model B (4GB or 8GB RAM)

Essentially a public fork of my private repo git@github.com:felker/dotfiles_remote.git as of 2021-02-10.

Public so I can bypass any SSH keypair setup specific to my Raspberry Pi's and instead directly clone this repo when setting up a new device (or pushing changes back here).
